        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</li>
          <li>It is responsible for the structure of a web page.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements, which is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Commonly used elements include: text, image, header, and list elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains important information (metadata) about the web page that help the browser render correctly. Elements included are not visible to a user on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements are also used to divide content on a page, and to describe content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>Common dividing/describing elements include: meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The declaration < !DOCTYPE html > tells the browser to expect HTML on the page. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>It is responsible for the appearance of a web page.</li>
          <li>A CSS document should be linked to an HTML document within the head element using a style tag.</li>
          <li>CSS can be applied as an internal stylesheet, external stylesheet, or inline.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS can be helpful when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, using a style attribute. They are not as flexible as external/internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually for each change.</li>
          <li>Internal stylesheets are located in the head section of the HTML file. The rules will only apply to that page. </li>
          <li>External stylesheets are created in an external CSS file and are the most preferred method.</li>
          <li>External stylesheets are linked to the file using a link element placed in the HTML head section.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. </li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. </li>
          <li>Classes and IDs are used to identify elements. </li>
          <li>A CSS rule is composed of a selector, which defines the element or attribute the rule will apply to, and a declaration block, which will apply a property and value.</li>
          <li>Using * as a selector will apply a rule to all visible elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is used for incorporating logic into a webpage for user interaction.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is typically executed from top to bottom, but can be interrupted using conditional statements such as if statements.</li>

          <li>Number variables and Boolean variables (true/false) do not require quotations.</li>

          <li>Conditionals are used to test if an expression is truthy or falsy.</li>
          <li>Functions are used to package functionality that can be reused by calling in the code.</li>
